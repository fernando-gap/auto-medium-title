# Auto Medium Title

A tool for myself to automatically enumerate every title of my daily medium blog -- a way for me to brainstorm about things.

On january 1st I started doing this "blog" and all my titles are followed by "Day" and a sequence of increasing digits ranging from one to infinity. Therefore, subsequent days are the sum of the previous day plus one. I then noticed I would lost count when february arrives, since it stops to follow the january calendar, because the month ends at 31 and start at 1 again in the next month. You may be asking yourself, why don't you check the previous day and then do the math yourself? I could, but I won't.

Instead, I created this tool just for it. The only thing I need to do it is to open medium drafts and my next write will be there!
