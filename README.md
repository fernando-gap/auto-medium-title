# Auto Medium Title

A tool for myself to automatically enumerate title of my daily medium blog, which is in fact a way for me to brainstorm about things. This tool is relatively simple.


On january 1st I started this "blog" and all my titles are followed by "Day" + {day in the year}. Therefore, subsequent days are the sum of the previous day count plus one. I then
noticed I would lost count when february arrives, because It was easy to check which day I am on. You may be asking yourself, why don't you check the previous day and they do the math yourself.
I could, but I won't. It is unreasonable to do it every day, I will miss.

Instead, I created this tool just for it. The only thing I need to do it is to open medium drafts and my next write will be there!
